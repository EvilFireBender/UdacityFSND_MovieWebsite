# Movie Trailer Website

The accompanying code builds a website that contains thumbnails of all my favourite movies, alongside their titles.
Clicking on one of these results in opening the youtube trailer of the corresponding movie. This has been achieved through OOP in Python.

## Setup and Usage

The system should have some version of Python installed in order to be able to run the code, and a web browser that opens the website.
For ease of use, the following files should be present in the same directory at the time of compilation:

* `entertainment_center.py`
* `fresh_tomatoes.py`
* `media.py`

To open and use the website, open `entertainment_center.py` and run it.

# Movie Trailer Website

The accompanying code builds a webpage that contains thumbnails of all my favourite movies, alongside their titles.
Clicking on one of these results in opening the youtube trailer of the corresponding movie. This has been achieved through OOP in Python.

## Setup and Usage

The system should have some version of Python installed in order to be able to run the code, and a web browser that opens the webpage.
For ease of use, the following files should be present in the same directory at the time of compilation:

* `entertainment_center.py`
* `fresh_tomatoes.py`
* `media.py`

To open and use the webpage, open `entertainment_center.py` using an IDE or the default python shell, and run it.
Once open, the webpage should display all movies mentioned in the code, and clicking on one of them should play the corresponding trailer.
